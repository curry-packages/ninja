Ninja build files
=================

[Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) calls itself the assembler of build systems.
It is meant to be used with a meta-build system.

This package offers simple generation of Ninja files with Curry programs.
It includes an abstract representation of Ninja's constructs and a pretty
printer to generate a build file in concrete syntax.
